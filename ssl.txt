$ sudo apt install openssl  [On Debian/Ubuntu]
$ sudo yum install openssl  [On CentOS/RHEL]
$ sudo dnf install openssl  [On Fedora]

Then issue the following command to generate a CSR and the key that will protect your certificate.

$ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout example.com.key -out example.com.csr

where:

    req enables the part of OpenSSL that handles certificate requests signing.
    -newkey rsa:2048 creates a 2048-bit RSA key.
    -nodes means “don’t encrypt the key”.
    -keyout example.com.key specifies the filename to write on the created private key.
    -out example.com.csr specifies the filename to write the CSR to.

Answer correctly, the questions you will be asked. Note that your answers should match information.

After creating your CSR, view the contents of the file using a cat utility, select it and copy it

$ cat example.com.csr
